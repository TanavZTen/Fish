Turn Rules

On your turn, ask one specific opponent for one specific card

Example: “Do you have the 10 of hearts?”

You may only ask for a card if your team already holds at least one card from that set

If they HAVE the card

They must give it to you

You continue your turn and may ask again

If they DO NOT have the card

Your turn ends immediately

It becomes their team’s turn

They may ask any opponent, not necessarily you

✅ This is important:
Turns pass by failure, not by player order.

Calling (Declaring) a Set

On your turn, you may call a set instead of asking

Your team must correctly name every card in that set

If the call is CORRECT

Your team scores 1 point

That set is removed from play

If the call is WRONG

The opposing team automatically gets that entire set

No guessing, no partial credit, no recovery

⚠️ This makes calling a set high risk, high reward

Winning

All 9 sets are eventually claimed

Team with the most sets wins

Why this version is brutal (in a good way)

Zero communication = pure deduction

A bad call can instantly swing the game

The 8s + jokers set is the hardest and most valuable to track

Strong players track:

Who asks for what

Who stops asking suddenly

Card flow between players
